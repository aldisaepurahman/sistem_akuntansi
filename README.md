# Sistem Akuntansi SIAKKU

This application was developed to simplify the accounting process, such as recording monthly transactions, calculating profit and loss, printing worksheets, and calculating the depreciation process of assets and income.

To complete this application, we started designing this application from the use case definition process, functional requirements, to finally entering the program code implementation process. The development process is very intense because it is also necessary to understand the process of running the accounting cycle so that this application can also be easy to use. Due to the large number of needs requested, as well as a minimal understanding of accounting, application development was slow at the beginning, but accelerated towards the end of the collaboration period.

Qe chose the desktop as the platform for this application to run because our client needs to open all of accounting data offline, and used Flutter to quickly work on the appearance of the application.

After the application has been developed and tested, it has the following list of features:

- **Login**, used to enter the application for users, with the aim of maintaining data security from the application.
- **Dashboard**, used to display statistical information on incoming transactions during the month.
- **Chart of Account (CoA)**, used to manage all account data from STIKes in processing transactions every month.
- **General Journal & Adjustment Journal**, used to manage and record all transactions that enter STIKes every month, and group them based on the type of journal available.
- **Ledger**, used to display all incoming transactions every month per account.
- **Worksheet**, used to display data on all total transaction balances from all existing accounts after calculating transactions and also profit and loss.
- **Profit and Loss**, used to display profit and loss data for that month.
- **Amortization**, used to display data on depreciation of goods or income at STIKes
